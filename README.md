# Save Modded Files
This is just a simple program that compares 2 folders and copies the files that differ into a new folder. It is intended to be used as a helpful tool for UFO 50 modders to extract out files that have been modded when given folders of file dumps from both the unmodded and modded game.

# How To Use
Set the 2 paths in the config.txt and then run the exe. The modded files will be copied into a new folder called "Modded Files".
